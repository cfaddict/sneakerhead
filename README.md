Sneakerhead

A small groovy and grails applicaiton to manage my shoe collection. This is just a small app I decided to write to help me learn Groovy and Grails. Think of this as a community based website where users can show off their sneaker collection.

Here are some random features this applicaiton will have. 

Public 
 + Bootstrap UI
 + Home page will just be a list of users that have profiles in our system
 + View list of shoes for a particular user. Allow sorting paging and searching.
 + Switch to grid view to show thumbnails instead of list.
 + View details shows pictures and allows for comments. Use https://disqus.com
 + details page will have some social integration with facebook + twitter. 

Admin
 + Secure admin area to manage profile data + collection information
 + manage only data that belongs to this user

Future Features

- I think the 1st revision of this will only be for me but a future version can take a user profile approach where each
user can show off their collection. 
- REST API 
- The idea of following another user to have a facebook type wall on your home page listing new shoes added by friends.
- find users by location
- some kind of cool view that is just a wall of photos and you can click through to view details
- mogodb integration
- storing images somewhere else such as amazon s3

Please send any ideas you have for this little ficticious application to danvega at gmail dot com.
