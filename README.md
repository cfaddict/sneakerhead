Sneakerhead

A small groovy and grails applicaiton to manage my shoe collection. This is just a small app I decided to write to help me learn Groovy and Grails

Here are some random features this applicaiton will have. 

Public 
 + Bootstrap UI
 + View list of shoes. Allow sorting paging and searching.
 + Switch to grid view to show thumbnails instead of list.
 + View details shows pictures and allows for comments.
 + details page will have some social integration with facebook + twitter. 

Admin
 + Secure admin area to manage data
 + manage only data that belongs to this user

Future Features

I think the 1st revision of this will only be for me but a future version can take a user profile approach where each
user can show off their collection. 

REST API 

Please send any ideas you have for this little ficticious application to danvega at gmail dot com.
